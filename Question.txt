The main objective of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is to examine household
electricity usage patterns to derive meaningful insights, detect inefficiencies, and enhance
energy management


Problem Statement:
Electricity consumption in households fluctuates throughout the day and across various
appliances. Gaining a clear understanding of these patterns is essential for optimizing energy
efficiency, lowering expenses, and promoting sustainable power usage. However, many
households lack detailed information on their electricity consumption, the appliances that
contribute most to their energy use, and the effects of voltage fluctuations on overall power
consumption.


Basic Data Understanding
1. What is the total number of records in the dataset?
2. Are there any missing values in the dataset? If so, in which columns?
3. What are the data types of each column?
4. What is the range of dates present in the dataset?


Descriptive Statistics
5. First you have to make a Total_Submetering column by adding the all submeterings.
6. What are the summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for
global_active_power, global_reactive_power, voltage, and global_intensity?
7. What is the mean and standard deviation of the Total_Submetering column?
8. What is the distribution of voltage in the dataset? (e.g., histogram or KDE plot)
9. What is the correlation between global_active_power and global_intensity?
10. How does global_active_power vary with voltage?
11. What are the minimum and maximum values of global_active_power, and at what
times did they occur?


Time-Based Analysis
12. How does global_active_power change over different hours of the day? (Hourly trend)
13. Are there any noticeable trends in power consumption over different days of the week?
14. How does Total_Submetering change over different hours of the day?
15. How does voltage fluctuate throughout a single day?
16. What is the average global_active_power usage for each month?


Sub-Metering Analysis
17. Which sub-metering category (sub_metering_1, sub_metering_2, or sub_metering_3)
consumes the most power on average?
18. How does Total_Submetering compare with global_active_power? Is there a strong
correlation?
19. How much energy is consumed outside of the three sub-metering categories
(global_active_power - Total_Submetering)?
20. Are there any specific time periods where Total_Submetering is significantly higher or
lower than usual?
21. Which hour of the day has the highest Total_Submetering on average?
