# üîå Household Power Consumption Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Household Power Consumption Dataset**, focusing on energy usage patterns across various time scales (hourly, daily, and monthly). The workflow includes **data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation studies, and trend visualizations** to derive actionable insights into household electricity consumption.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

| Attribute              | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Records                | `df.shape` ‚Üí Total number of rows & columns      |
| Missing Values         | Checked using `df.isnull().sum()`                |
| Data Types             | Verified with `df.info()`                        |
| Date Range             | From `df['Date'].min()` to `df['Date'].max()`    |
| Sub-metering Columns   | `Sub_metering_1`, `Sub_metering_2`, `Sub_metering_3` |

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Replaced `"?"` with `NaN` in power and sub-metering columns  
- Converted data types to **float**  
- Filled missing values with **0**  
- Created a new column for total sub-metering:
- Converted `Date` and `Time` to **DateTime** format  
- Extracted **Hour, Day, and Month** features for temporal analysis

## ‚úÖ Key Findings

- **Sub_metering_3** is consistently the highest energy consumer.  
- **Total_Submetering strongly correlates (0.83) with Global Active Power**, validating its role as a reliable measure of total household consumption.  
- Hourly and daily consumption trends highlight **peak demand periods**, offering potential for energy optimization.  
- A fraction of energy remains **unmetered by sub-meters**, suggesting consumption from appliances not tracked individually.
